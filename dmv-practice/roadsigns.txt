Are you getting ready for your permit test? Knowing the fundamentals of road signs is required if you want to pass your exam. With our free road signs test, you can get the necessary practice and prove your knowledge of the meanings of road signs.

The importance of road signs
Why is it so crucial to know road signs? Road signs warn drivers and other traffic participants of potential driving hazards and dangerous situations. Drivers are aware of various obstacles like icy roads, animal crossings, or speed bumps and know that disregarding them can cause injury to themselves or others.

Can you be allowed on the road? See if you can get your license.

Types of road signs
There are various types of road signs. Some of them will warn you of impending danger. Others direct you to your destination or control the flow of traffic. Let’s learn about the different categories of road signs.

Regulatory signs
Regulatory signs inform people about the laws of the road. They almost always have white backgrounds, except for stop and yield signs that have red backgrounds.

It’s time for your permit practice!

Warning signs
Warning signs alert road users of things like merging traffic, railroad crossings, traffic signals, and various potentially dangerous situations that might require special attention. These signs are typically in a diamond shape, yellow or orange in color, and have black lettering.  This category includes traffic warning signs, object markers, and crossing signs.

Guide signs
Guide signs direct people to particular destinations such as cities, airports, and highways. They tell you how far away you are from your destination, what highway you are on, or what exit is coming up. Mile markers, exit signs, and route markers are all guide signs.

Prohibitive signs
Prohibitive signs are used to prevent certain activities from happening. They have red borders and a white or blue background, sometimes with a diagonal red slash to indicate something is not allowed. They include signs like “No entry,” “Vehicles prohibited,” “No smoking,” “Do not use lift” and others.

Informational signs
Distances from major cities or destinations are indicated by informational signs, as are directions on where to go, instructions on how to use something, or the purpose of an area or object. Informational signs are generally green or blue with white letters.

Construction signs
Construction signs tell you to prepare for something like a construction site, road work ahead, temporary speed limit (related to constructions in-progress), or detour from the usual route. They are usually orange and diamond-shaped.

If you want to be a commercial driver, don’t skip this CDL practice!

School zone signs
These signs let you know you are in a school zone and must be mindful of the presence of children. Driving slowly and paying careful attention are essential in these areas. For example, a school speed limit sign indicates you are not to exceed this speed limit while in the school zone. These signs are usually bright green or orange and pentagon-shaped. Nowadays, they are often fluorescent.

Other road signs
Some signs don’t belong to any of these categories. Wheelchair-accessible areas, restaurants, lodging, rest areas, and gas stations are all indicated by service signs. Recreation signs point you to picnic areas, hiking trails, or bathrooms. Incident management signs will warn you of an upcoming accident, emergency scene, closed lane, or exit.


Road signs colors
Red color refers to the events where you must stop, yield, or turn around. It is a distinctive and bold color that immediately conveys the message: “Stop,” “Do not enter,” or “Wrong way.”

The color yellow on road signs denotes a general warning. It warns of potential hazards or changes in road conditions. The fluorescent yellow-green color is a relatively new invention, and it is associated with pedestrians, school zones, and bicycling activity.


The color green you can see on signs relating to giving directions or guiding traffic participants to specific areas. Blue signs display information for people traveling, like information about rest stops, campgrounds, and other services used by motorists.

Orange road signs are typically associated with construction, infrastructure work, and road upkeep. When you see signage like that, keep an eye out for workers on or near the road.

Brown signs mark or give directions to historical landmarks, national parks, picnic areas, touring and camping sites, theme parks, and other similar places.

Do colors of road signs confuse you? Check if you could be colorblind.

Road signs test
With our road signs test, you can practice for your real exam. To successfully complete the test, you must get at least 80% of the correct responses – 16 points. Can you do it? Find out how good of a driver you are with this road signs test!

Hello, everyone! Could you pass the New York State driving test? Check it out right away with our quiz. Twenty questions to consider, then see the result!

Permit Practice Test
Every state issues its own unique driver’s licenses as a result of federalism. Neither does the federal government. Most of the time, motorists are required to obtain a pass in their native state, and all states recognize permits from non-residents who satisfy the age requirements. The usage of motorcycles is also regulated by the license.

A commercial driver’s license, which is necessary to operate:

heavy-size vehicles (buses, lorries, tractor-trailers)
vehicles carrying at least 16 people
vehicles transporting hazardous commodities.
A state may also take away a person’s right to use the road inside its boundaries for traffic violations. Most states employ a similar structure of license classes, with a few differences.

Driver’s License
For instance, commercial license courses are regulated by federal law at 49 CFR 383. Small numerals are frequently displayed beside each data field on licenses and ID cards. The AAMVA design standard, which several US states have accepted, mandates this. There were about 227 million registered drivers in the country as of 2018, according to the US Department of Transportation.

State and municipal governments gained a new authority when the number of vehicles United States surpassed tens of thousands: the ability to authorize cars and drivers. The very first province to register vehicles was New York in 1901. By 1918, all US states needed license plates; however, they took longer to mandate driver’s licenses.

Despite widespread worries about incompetent drivers, only 39 states had them by 1935, and few of them required a test. Early drivers received their driving instruction from:

car dealers
family members
acquaintances
groups like the YMCA.
Many high schools began offering driving education in the 1930s.

The first states to mandate a driver’s license were Massachusetts and Missouri in 1903, although there was no exam to obtain the license. Henry Ford introduced the Model T in 1908, making it the first vehicle that many middle-class Americans could purchase. In the same year that the Model T was introduced, Rhode Island was also the first jurisdiction to mandate indeed a permit and a driving test. Before the 1980s, pictures were absent from Maryland’s driver’s licenses.

Young Drivers
Teenagers starting to drive has largely decreased among young people since the 1990s compared to earlier decades. Reduced interest in driving, brought on by worries about the environment and road safety, as well as financial concerns as well as stricter requirements for obtaining a license, have all been recognized as possible explanations for this decline.

Commercial Driver’s License
To operate big and heavy vehicles, such as buses, trucks, and tractor-trailers with a gross vehicle weight limit of 26,001 pounds or more, in commerce, you need a commercial driver’s license (CDL). No of the size of the vehicle, a CDL is necessary if it will be used to carry placarded hazardous items or at least 16 people (including the driver). The age requirement in Hawaii is 21, compared to the national average of 18 years old.  Prior to granting a commercial driver’s license, all states require an unrestricted driving permit.


Hawaii was the final and only state to maintain a 21-year-old age limit for a CDL Class A on May 14, 2022, when New York lowered this from 21 to 18 years. Previously, under New York Law, individuals aged 18 to 20 could obtain a CDL Class B or C, and not a CDL Class A, until they turned 21. To address the national truck driver shortage, President Joe Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allowed a pilot trial that would let 18 to 20-year-olds with a CDL engage in interstate commerce, assuming they met all other standards for doing so.

The majority of recreational and agricultural vehicles, including fire engines, modified busses, tractors, lawnmowers, and full-size campers, are free from CDL requirements. Federal law does, however, permit states to mandate a CDL for certain cars. Some jurisdictions demand that operators of big, heavy vehicles used only for agricultural and recreational purposes convert to a special driving license or add an attachment to their license, generally by completing a written test, a road test, or both.

For instance, California requires drivers of recreational vehicles to have a “non-commercial” permit (to distinguish it from a commercial driver’s license) to drive or tow a camper that is between 40 and 45 feet in length. In New York, a driver’s license must have an R endorsement if the GVWR of the recreational vehicle exceeds 26,000 pounds.
